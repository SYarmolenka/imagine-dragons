The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California. An EP entitled Continued Silence was released on Valentine's Day (February 14, 2012) digitally and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200. The band also released an EP titled Hear Me in 2012.\n<-$&%->\nShortly after, \"It's Time\" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video debuted on April 17, 2012 on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the \"Best Rock Video\" category. \"It's Time\" was certified a double platinum single by the RIAA.\n<-$&%->\nThe band finished recording their debut album Night Visions in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on the day after Labor Day (September 4, 2012). It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year. Night Visions is certified platinum by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the Billboard Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.\n<-$&%->\nThe album's second single \"Radioactive\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs, Billboard Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than seven million singles in the United States, smashing a record by spending 87 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Radioactive\" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013. It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history. By the end of 2013, \"Radioactive\" had already sold over 3 million copies. Rolling Stone called it \"the biggest rock hit of the year\". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify in the United States. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter of the two. In 2015, it was certified diamond by the RIAA for sales in excess of 10 million copies in the United States. Third single \"Demons\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Songs and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold more than 5 million copies in the United States to date.\n<-$&%->\nBillboard listed them as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\". Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist. Amazon.com called the band their \"Favorite Rock artist of 2012\".\n<-$&%->\nIn 2013, Imagine Dragons returned to Europe and North America with the Night Visions Tour. The band announced 13 additional US summer tour dates which also sold out. The band then announced a North America Amphitheatre tour. The band also confirmed that they were unable to fulfill the request of acting as support for Muse. Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average box office gross despite their average ticket price being the third lowest on the list.\n<-$&%->\nThe band released a live album, Live at Independent Records, in April 2013."},"tracks":[{"id":"5d708424-bbbe-5dc6-b6fe-498b2ae949a8","content":"Radioactive"},{"id":"a6961fd2-e0cc-5127-a180-451e8f32e646","content":"Tiptoe"},{"id":"2714ba5f-c7c0-5be6-a75c-e273b106e26f","content":"It's Time"},{"id":"1fe366ce-e9a9-5d61-93fb-19de44d000c7","content":"Demons"},{"id":"c6535432-8c82-54a3-be50-6176fff307a7","content":"On Top of the World"},{"id":"95648878-b071-5bce-b613-8b3c74ea39db","content":"Amsterdam"},{"id":"5e27360c-9631-592d-be2e-30932d0abeb8","content":"Hear Me"},{"id":"eae777f5-67c9-5bbf-87b2-f8dc5a896b4c","content":"Every Night"},{"id":"7025cff1-1fdd-56fa-8334-5a8a0893fc2f","content":"Bleeding Out"},{"id":"231459c9-357d-5856-88e6-da08e8bb9e42","content":"Underdog"},{"id":"5f5c5eff-add5-5e86-9edc-2bd5da9a70ad","content":"Nothing Left to Say / Rocks"},{"id":"566d86a8-4dba-5c31-b50d-d4c9751109bc","content":"Cha-Ching (Till We Grow Older)"},{"id":"bd99ab3d-8e30-55de-9654-6208ad36e4c6","content":"Working Man"},{"id":"7fd8153a-f81b-52c4-9c76-1e7e616bb98d","content":"Fallen"}]}}
