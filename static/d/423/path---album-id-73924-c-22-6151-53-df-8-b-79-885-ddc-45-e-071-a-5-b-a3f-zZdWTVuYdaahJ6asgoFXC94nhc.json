The time-lapse videos featured lead singer Dan Reynolds drawing surreal images on a drawing pad. Morse code was hidden in the videos and translated to \"objects of same color\".\n<-$&%->\nOn February 1, 2017, Imagine Dragons released \"Believer\" as the lead single for their next album. \"Believer\" was used as part of the Super Bowl ad for the Nintendo Switch. Imagine Dragons were part of the Wayhome summer 2017 lineup in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. On April 27, 2017, Imagine Dragons released \"Thunder\" as the second single from their third album.
