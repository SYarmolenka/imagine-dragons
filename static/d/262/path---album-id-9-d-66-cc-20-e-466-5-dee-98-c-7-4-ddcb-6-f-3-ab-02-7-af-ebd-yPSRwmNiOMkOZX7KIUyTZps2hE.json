and had no better place to end this tour\". The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the Night Visions album cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the Night Visions cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\".\n<-$&%->\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"New Year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that we're really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\". Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it's still Imagine Dragons, but we've got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think the new material is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We're just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". Drummer Daniel Platzman added that the band are critical of themselves, with \"no room for external pressure\".\n<-$&%->\nInspired greatly by the band's travels on both their previous tours and the Night Visions Tour, the album explored world culture as a musical item and overall motif in the album. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper The Times-Picayune that there was \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn from \"the world tour\". You kind of realize that you're a lot smaller than you think\". In addition, Reynolds stated to music magazine Rolling Stone that the next album will be \"different\" from Night Visions, and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with Night Visions, but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It's too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n<-$&%->\nPrior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film Transformers: Age of Extinction, called \"Battle Cry\" (June 2014) and song \"Warriors\" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).\n<-$&%->\nOn October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, \"I Bet My Life\" via several visual snippets on Facebook and Instagram. It was released on October 27. It was sent to US Alternative radio for adds on November 3.\n<-$&%->\nImagine Dragons performed in Seoul World Cup Stadium, South Korea, at the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and the halftime show at the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n<-$&%->\nOn December 12, 2014, Imagine Dragons posted on social media a request that fans in the US look around their city for some surprises and post their findings. They also hinted about two locations in Las Vegas. Shortly, billboards featuring artwork, the band's name, a hashtag (\"#smoke+mirrors\"), and an additional titles, presumed to be the track names were discovered. The following titles were revealed \"Summer\", \"Shots\", \"Polaroid\", \"I'm So Sorry\", and \"Gold\". Next, the band direct messaged various fans puzzle pieces of the artwork for the album (each file numbered, at least 13 in total). When combined, the puzzle pieces appear to reveal the cover art and album title. The title, cover art, and release date were revealed on social media two days later.\n<-$&%->\nWorking with Metric, which did a three-song acoustic set, Imagine Dragons played at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles on February 5, 2015. The half-hour set included the breakthrough songs \"It's Time\" and \"Radioactive\" from Night Visions. The performance was the live debut for \"Summer\" and \"I'm So Sorry\", along with \"Gold\" and \"I Bet My Life\" from the album Smoke + Mirrors, which was released on February 17, 2015. The band's 2015 North American summer tour began in Portland, Oregon on June 3.\n<-$&%->\nDuring the band's tour, Imagine Dragons released two non-album singles. \"Roots\" was released on August 26, 2015 and \"I Was Me\" on October 12, 2015 via iTunes. The band also released a cover of \"I Love You All the Time\" by Eagles of Death Metal on December 18, 2015, in support of the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks. The Smoke + Mirrors Tour ended on February 5, 2016 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n<-$&%->\nIn an interview, Reynolds told Billboard that the band would be taking a hiatus for the remainder of 2016, stating, \"This is the year we're going to actually take time off. We haven't stopped in, like, six years, so we've forced ourselves to at least take a year off.\" The band released a one night only concert film, Imagine Dragons In Concert: Smoke + Mirrors, in select theaters on March 2, 2016. The film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray under the title Imagine Dragons: Smoke + Mirrors Live. They also released the song \"Not Today\" from the soundtrack for Me Before You on April 28. The band also appears on the soundtrack for the film Suicide Squad. The song, titled \"Sucker for Pain\", features Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, Logic, Ty Dolla Sign, and X Ambassadors.\n<-$&%->\nThe band recorded the song \"Levitate\" for the science fiction film Passengers. The track was released on November 28, 2016."},"tracks":[{"id":"b7dd41b7-71cd-50c6-b065-cc634eb50e8a","content":"Shots"},{"id":"f065e70a-d7a4-5818-aecd-ee12c1ec7fdc","content":"Gold"},{"id":"696d93a0-7a28-543d-802b-b52257cfb842","content":"Smoke And Mirrors"},{"id":"da18b537-fc86-54ef-a51f-2ce5ca80c2ac","content":"I’m So Sorry"},{"id":"13974155-56f7-5ff4-8057-1d89076ef66e","content":"I Bet My Life"},{"id":"478e4816-95d8-5699-9605-c8ec70dbf7d1","content":"Polaroid"},{"id":"9766e5dd-69e9-5818-bb02-538d71122e1f","content":"Friction"},{"id":"02b17087-3ab6-52e1-a21c-195d3b5cf148","content":"It Comes Back To You"},{"id":"29b0357f-7582-5d1a-a52a-51e1ca19138e","content":"Dream"},{"id":"207042e0-d8fb-5ca6-883c-1c3a508fe136","content":"Trouble"},{"id":"1165b0a9-4b11-5f5c-a8e8-b6d6aa2759dd","content":"Summer"},{"id":"d45ef131-90e8-5b89-9598-4097021e903a","content":"Hopeless Opus"},{"id":"63511b9d-a098-5b97-9916-2acb8d209ae4","content":"The Fall"},{"id":"947912f1-7404-56f5-8c8d-bd4a1c64e0db","content":"Thief"},{"id":"3958b976-95d6-562f-99ff-59cc01164d45","content":"The Unknown"},{"id":"7fb292b0-aaf0-5351-bf29-b69114590244","content":"Second Chances"},{"id":"6bffce6b-1545-5384-bff8-2bc545532077","content":"Release"},{"id":"e6013f85-67bd-5e07-a273-59cf6ba24ff3","content":"Warriors"},{"id":"faf6c665-b563-53a5-b23e-c2cb92a3fa1b","content":"Battle Cry"},{"id":"fed850d2-e355-59e0-8292-3c0bba5f2e64","content":"Monster"},{"id":"b18153c8-88f1-5670-87b1-76f4e6d1b957","content":"Who We Are"}]}}}
